# employee-management
I have created an employee manaeement system listing employees, departments and managers.  I have set up promps that will tell which manager and employee belongs to which department and which role that employee plays in that department.  I set up those prompts using the node inquirer package.  I also used MySQL to create three tables for my app- one for departments, one for roles, and one for employees.  I also put the My SQL codes into my Visual Studio Code.
